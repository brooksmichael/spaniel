		<p class = "info-left"> The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a small purebred known for being affectionate, cheerful, courageous, gentle, and social. The most common colors for Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are black and tan, blenheim, ruby, and tricolor. To keep it healthy, it will need to get exercise regularly. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel commonly participates in competitive obedience.</p>
		<p class = "info-right">You can’t help being enchanted by the big, twinkling eyes of the Cavalier, a gentle, pint-sized bundle (13 to 18 pounds) of tail-wagging joy. Friendly and easily trained, the Cavalier is an ideal companion for families with young children and other pets. "Sex and the City" fans will recognize this breed as the same as Charlotte’s dog, Elizabeth Taylor, but they first gained popularity as the preferred pet of King Charles II and still appear frequently on the UK Kennel Club’s list of most popular breeds.</p>
